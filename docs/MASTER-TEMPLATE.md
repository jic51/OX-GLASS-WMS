# Building the master template

The one file every customer copies. Get this wrong and each of them receives OX
Glass's inventory, and OX Glass's email sitting in their user list as an admin
of *their* system.

## Why this is not just "delete the rows"

Copying a Sheet copies the **sheet data** — movements, users, catalogs,
everything. It does **not** copy Script Properties, which is why company name and
setup state reset on a copy while the rows do not. That asymmetry is the whole
trap: the copy *looks* fresh (it asks for setup) while still holding the
previous company's data.

Cached Drive folder IDs matter too. They live in Script Properties, so they
don't copy — but if any survived they would point at folders in the master
owner's Drive that the customer cannot reach.

## Steps

1. **Copy the working spreadsheet.** Never do the rest on the live one.
   File → Make a copy. Name it something obviously not production.

2. **In the copy:** `🏭 Acopio → 🔧 Advanced → 💣 Erase everything`.
   It shows the file name and asks you to type `ERASE`. Read the file name in
   that prompt before typing — it is the last thing standing between you and
   wiping production.

   Clears all data sheets (headers kept), all CONFIG catalogs, every
   identity/secret Script Property, every cached folder ID, and every trigger.

3. **Verify:** `🔧 Advanced → 🔎 Check if this copy is a clean template`.
   It re-reads the file and lists anything a customer would receive. "The wipe
   reported success" and "the file is clean" are different claims; only the
   second one counts.

4. **Rename the Apps Script project** — Extensions → Apps Script, click the name
   top-left. This is what customers see on Google's permission screen, and code
   cannot set it (see docs/BACKLOG.md, hidden default Cloud project).

5. **Paste the current code**, if the copy is behind: `Code.gs`, `Index.html`,
   `SetupWizard.html`, `appsscript.json`. Check `APP_VERSION` matches in both
   Code.gs and Index.html.

6. **Share:** Anyone with the link → **Viewer**. Viewer, not Editor — an Editor
   could change the template every future customer copies.

7. **Hand out the /copy link:** take the file URL and replace `/edit...` with
   `/copy`.

8. **Copy it yourself once and run the wizard end to end.** This is the only way
   to see what a customer actually sees, and the only way to check what the
   publish step reports on a genuinely fresh copy — the open question behind the
   dead-link problem in v9.10.

## Re-check before every release

Anything that adds a sheet has to be added to `TEMPLATE_DATA_SHEETS`, and
anything that adds an identity/secret property to `TEMPLATE_WIPE_PROPS` (both in
Code.gs). They are explicit lists rather than "clear everything unknown" so a
mistake is visible in a diff — but that only helps if the lists are updated.
