Checks that run before anything is sent to Jose. All four, every time.

```
python3 tools/check-refs.py Index_v3_fixed.html Code_v3_fixed.gs
node --check <js extracted from the HTML <script> blocks>
node --check <Code_v3_fixed.gs copied to .js>
node tools/test-modal-shield.js
node tools/test-button-states.js
node tools/test-topbar-deck.js
```

The browser tests need `npm install playwright` once; Chromium is already on
the machine (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-*/chrome-linux/chrome`, override with
`CHROME_PATH`).

## Why there are browser tests at all

`node --check` parses. It does not run. `check-refs.py` finds calls to
functions nobody defined. Between them they catch typos and missing code, and
they caught nothing at all when v9.63 shipped code that was valid and simply
never stopped — an observer loop that starved the page and left the app on a
blank loading screen.

Anything that behaves over TIME — an observer, a timer, a state a button has to
come back from — is invisible to both. Those get a browser test.

- `test-modal-shield.js` — the window shield: one sync at startup and no loop,
  background frozen, front window live, stacking in both directions, everything
  released on close.
- `test-button-states.js` — the busy/done helpers: a button always gets its
  label back, on success and on failure, and the callback never runs before the
  tick or gets lost when the button is missing.
- `test-topbar-deck.js` — the notification pile's open/close (driven from JS
  because CSS `:hover` fed back into itself and made the front card resize three
  times), the scroll lock while it is open, the exit animation, and a
  MEASUREMENT that the tab bar is centred. That last one is the argument for
  browser tests in one line: the old auto-margin layout put the tabs 146px off
  centre and looked almost right.

Both lift the real code out of `Index_v3_fixed.html` rather than keeping a copy,
so they cannot quietly drift away from what ships.
