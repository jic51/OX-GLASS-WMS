Checks that run before anything is sent to Jose. All four, every time.

`tools/audit-responsive.js` is a tape measure, not a test — run it when layout
changes, read the numbers, fix what they show, run it again.

The browser tests need `npm install playwright` once; Chromium is already on
the machine (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-*/chrome-linux/chrome`, override with
`CHROME_PATH`).

## Why there are browser tests at all

`node --check` parses. It does not run. `check-refs.py` finds calls to
functions nobody defined. Between them they catch typos and missing code, and
they caught nothing at all when v9.63 shipped code that was valid and simply
never stopped — an observer loop that starved the page and left the app on a
blank loading screen.

Anything that behaves over TIME — an observer, a timer, a state a button has to
come back from — is invisible to both. Those get a browser test.

- `test-modal-shield.js` — the window shield: one sync at startup and no loop,
  background frozen, front window live, stacking in both directions, everything
  released on close.
- `test-button-states.js` — the busy/done helpers: a button always gets its
  label back, on success and on failure, and the callback never runs before the
  tick or gets lost when the button is missing.
- `test-topbar-deck.js` — the notification pile's open/close (driven from JS
  because CSS `:hover` fed back into itself and made the front card resize three
  times), the scroll lock while it is open, the exit animation, and a
  MEASUREMENT that the tab bar is centred. That last one is the argument for
  browser tests in one line: the old auto-margin layout put the tabs 146px off
  centre and looked almost right.
- `audit-responsive.js` — opens the real app at six device sizes, on every tab,
  and reports sideways page scroll, controls too small for a thumb, anything
  past the right edge, and page errors. Screenshots land in ./audit/.
- `test-checkin.js` — runCheckin_'s milestone bookkeeping (Code_v3_fixed.gs),
  run in a Node vm with Apps Script's globals stubbed and time itself faked:
  fires once per milestone, never twice, catches up a backlog of overdue
  milestones as ONE email not several, stays silent when the customer is
  actually using the app, stays silent with no SUPPORT_EMAIL configured, and
  backfills SETUP_COMPLETED_AT on a pre-existing install without a false alarm.
- `test-pricing.js` — the weighted-average cost engine (addMovementsBatch_'s
  pricing branch, saveAvgCostUpdates_, and their real dependencies), lifted
  verbatim into a Node vm against fake in-memory sheets: bootstraps on a
  material's first cost, blends by quantity on the next one, a blank cost
  changes nothing, EXIT/WASTE always price from the average and ignore
  whatever a client sends, an unpriced material gets a blank cost (never a
  misleading 0), a purchase split across racks still blends correctly, cents
  round properly, and the CONFIG write-back updates one row per material
  rather than appending a duplicate on every entry.

Both lift the real code out of `Index_v3_fixed.html` rather than keeping a copy,
so they cannot quietly drift away from what ships.
